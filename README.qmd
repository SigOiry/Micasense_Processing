This workflow adapts the Micasense workflow for manual processing of images from the Micasense RedEdge-MX Dual camera. he original workflow, written in Python, is available [here](https://github.com/micasense/imageprocessing). This repository aims to translate the Python workflow into an R workflow. The python workflow is no longer maintained and requires specific versions of each package to function correctly. Don't enjoy spending hours just setting up your Python environment? This repo is made for you!

The original aims of micasense when they created this processing workflow was to help researchers and developers to do their own image processing. While a number of commercial tools fully support processing MicaSense data into reflectance maps, there are a number of reasons to process your own data, including controlling the entire radiometric workflow (for academic or publication reasons), pre-processing images to be used in a non-radiometric photogrammetry suite, or processing single sets of 10 images without building a larger map.

I will personally use this workflow to process single static images, where the usual structure-from-motion photogrammetry technique cannot be used.

## Dual-MX Sensor
<img src="img/Bandswv.png" width="50%" align="right" style="padding-left:10px;background-color:white;" />

The dual-MX camera have a spectral resolution of 10 bands, ranging from the blue (444nm) to the NIR (840nm).

## Packages

The first thing to do is to ensure that all the packages are ready to be used. The [exiftoolr](https://github.com/JoshOBrien/exiftoolr) packages is used to read Exif of tiff files. After installing the package you will need to run this line of code : `exiftoolr::install_exiftool()`.

```{r Packages}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: true
#| code-fold: true

require(tidyverse)
require(exiftoolr)
require(terra)
```

## Locate images and Reading metadata used to orthorectify, calibrate and align images

The code is used to find the path for each individual image, identify each band, and extract all the necessary metadata.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true

image_df<-"Dual_MX_Images" %>% 
  list.files(recursive = T, full.names = T) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  rename(path = ".") %>% 
  mutate(image_name = gsub(".*/","",path),
         image_ID = substr(image_name,5,8),
         Band = paste0("B",gsub(".*_","",image_name) %>% gsub(".tif","",.))) 

meta <-data.frame(
  Image_name = image_df$image_name,
  Image_Path = image_df$path,
  Make = NA,
  Model = NA,
  Exposure_Time = NA,
  Gain = NA,
  Resolution = NA,
  Band_Name = NA,
  Central_Wavelength = NA,
  Band_Width = NA,
  Capture_ID = NA,
  Flight_ID = NA,
  Focal_Length = NA,
  Black_Level = NA,
  Radiometric_Calibration_a1 = NA,
  Radiometric_Calibration_a2 = NA,
  Radiometric_Calibration_a3 = NA
)

for (i in 1:nrow(image_df)){
  exif<-exif_read(image_df$path[i])
  
  meta$Make[i]<-exif$Make
  meta$Model[i]<-exif$Model
  meta$Exposure_Time[i]<-exif$ExposureTime
  meta$Gain[i]<-exif$ISOSpeed

  meta$Band_Width[i]<-exif$WavelengthFWHM
  meta$Capture_ID[i]<-exif$CaptureId
  meta$Flight_ID[i]<-exif$FlightId
  meta$Focal_Length[i]<-exif$FocalLength
  meta$Black_Level[i]<-mean(as.numeric(str_split(exif$BlackLevel," " )[[1]]))
  meta$Radiometric_Calibration_a1[i]<-as.numeric(exif$RadiometricCalibration[[1]][1])
  meta$Radiometric_Calibration_a2[i]<-as.numeric(exif$RadiometricCalibration[[1]][2])
  meta$Radiometric_Calibration_a3[i]<-as.numeric(exif$RadiometricCalibration[[1]][3])
}
